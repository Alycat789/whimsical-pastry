Brainstorming!

GUI:
    main menu window will take you to a separate window: saved card or the creation menu

Creation Interface:
    enter list of attainable yet whimsical new year goals
        -provide a list of goals to use if the user is not creative
        -if the goals don't fill out whatever size grid is created either prompt the user to enter x number more, or add in x number placeholder goals.
    choose color theme?
    show a mock up of options as they are selected
    
Saved Card:
    square of (5 or 7) row/col boxes (accommodate for the free space in center)
    each box can be covered when clicked on (have options: bingo dot, X, hippo, etc)
    create a running "done" list of the completed tasks attached to saved card(to bask in the dopamine!)
